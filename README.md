# RSA-Encryption
A CLI RSA encryption/decryption program

This is a basic, textbook example of RSA encryption. Any real implementation of this kind of encryption would likely be more involved than this, but the purpose of this repository and the accompanying video tutorial is to be a coding exercise and simple example of how the technology works.

*Options*
- Generate RSA Key Pair
- Encrypt message from file
- Decrypt message from file
- Encrypt message in terminal
- Decrypt message in terminal

Key pairs come in two parts: product of primes (N), and exponent (e/d)
